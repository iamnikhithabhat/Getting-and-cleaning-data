Basic concepts:

* Body represents motion related to the subjects body, like the subject's own movements
* Grav represents motion related to the gravitational pull of earth
* Jerk represents a variable derived in time using linerar acceleration and angular velocity
* Mag represents the magnitude of three dimensional signals calculated using the Euclidian norm
* Gyro represents the angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope
* Time domain represents the initial data collection over time
* Frequency domain represents the data processed by a fast fourier transform. 
* All variables are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
* For more information see the features_info.txt and readme file in the data set
The following variables are all averages of that data type for a particular subject + action combination
